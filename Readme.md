* I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript To build the website. And also use GitHub to share source code link.
* I test this website in google chrome. In Google Chrome's Inspect element, toggle the Device toolbar.

* I didn't have much trouble doing this because I have done this type of work before.
* I make this website responsive to different devices using media screens.
